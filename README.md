## 🚀 BMAD Methodology: Agile Development Automation

**BMAD (Business-Minded Agile Development)** transforms your development process into a fully automated agile workflow with role-based AI agents and quality gates.

### One Command, Complete Workflow

```bash
/bmad-pilot "Build e-commerce checkout system with payment integration"
# Automated: Product → Architecture → Sprint → Dev → Review → QA
```

## 🎯 BMAD Workflow Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    PO[Product Owner] -->|PRD 90+| Architect
    Architect -->|Design 90+| SM[Scrum Master]
    SM -->|Sprint Plan| Dev
    Dev -->|Code| Review
    Review -->|Pass/Fail| QA
    QA -->|Tests| Done
```

### Key Features

- **🤖 6 Specialized Agents**: PO, Architect, SM, Dev, Review, QA
- **📊 Quality Gates**: 90% thresholds with automatic optimization
- **✅ Approval Points**: User confirmation at critical phases
- **📁 Persistent Artifacts**: All documents saved to `./.claude/specs/`
- **🔄 Iterative Refinement**: Automatic improvement until quality met

## 📋 BMAD Agents & Roles

| Agent | Role | Quality Gate | Output |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| **bmad-po** (Sarah) | Product requirements gathering | 90/100 PRD score | `01-product-requirements.md` |
| **bmad-architect** (Winston) | Technical design & architecture | 90/100 design score | `02-system-architecture.md` |
| **bmad-sm** (Mike) | Sprint planning & task breakdown | User approval | `03-sprint-plan.md` |
| **bmad-dev** (Alex) | Feature implementation | Code completion | Implementation files |
| **bmad-review** | Independent code review | Pass/Risk/Fail | `04-dev-reviewed.md` |
| **bmad-qa** (Emma) | Testing & quality assurance | Test execution | `05-qa-report.md` |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Plugin System (Recommended) 🎯

```bash
# List available plugins
/plugin list

# Install specific workflow plugins
/plugin install bmad-agile-workflow         # BMAD methodology
/plugin install requirements-driven-development  # Requirements workflow
/plugin install development-essentials      # Core dev commands
/plugin install advanced-ai-agents         # GPT-5 integration

# View plugin details
/plugin info bmad-agile-workflow
```

#### Method 2: Traditional Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/claude-code-workflows.git
cd claude-code-workflows

# Install everything with make
make install

# Or deploy specific workflows
make deploy-bmad          # Deploy BMAD workflow only
make deploy-requirements  # Deploy Requirements workflow only
make deploy-all          # Deploy all commands and agents
```

### Basic BMAD Workflow

```bash
# Full agile workflow with all phases
/bmad-pilot "User authentication system with OAuth2 and MFA"

# Skip testing for quick prototypes
/bmad-pilot "Admin dashboard" --skip-tests

# Direct development (skip sprint planning)
/bmad-pilot "Bug fix for login issue" --direct-dev

# Skip repository scanning (use existing context)
/bmad-pilot "Add feature" --skip-scan
```

### Workflow Artifacts

Each BMAD run creates structured documentation:

```
.claude/specs/user-authentication/
├── 00-repository-context.md    # Repository analysis
├── 01-product-requirements.md  # PRD with business goals
├── 02-system-architecture.md   # Technical design
├── 03-sprint-plan.md           # Sprint tasks
├── 04-dev-reviewed.md          # Code review report (NEW v3.1)
└── 05-qa-report.md            # Test results
```

## 🎨 BMAD Output Style

The BMAD workflow uses a specialized output style that:
- Creates phase-separated contexts
- Manages agent handoffs
- Tracks quality scores
- Handles approval gates
- Supports Codex CLI integration

## ⚡ v3.2 Plugin System

### 🔌 Native Plugin Support (NEW)
This project now includes native Claude Code plugin support with 4 ready-to-use plugin packages:

#### Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description | Commands | Agents |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| **bmad-agile-workflow** | Full BMAD methodology with role-based agents | `/bmad-pilot` | bmad-po, bmad-architect, bmad-sm, bmad-dev, bmad-qa |
| **requirements-driven-development** | Streamlined requirements workflow | `/requirements-pilot` | requirements-generate, requirements-code, requirements-review |
| **development-essentials** | Core development commands | `/code`, `/debug`, `/test`, `/optimize` | code, bugfix, debug, develop |
| **advanced-ai-agents** | GPT-5 deep analysis integration | - | gpt5 |

#### Using Plugins

```bash
# List all available plugins
/plugin list

# Get detailed information about a plugin
/plugin info bmad-agile-workflow

# Install a plugin to activate its commands and agents
/plugin install requirements-driven-development

# Remove an installed plugin
/plugin remove development-essentials
```

#### Plugin Configuration
Plugins are defined in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` following the Claude Code plugin specification. Each plugin includes:
- Commands (slash commands)
- Agents (specialized AI agents)
- Metadata (version, author, keywords)
- Category classification

## ⚡ v3.1 Features

### Independent Code Review Agent
- **bmad-review**: Automated review between Dev and QA
- **Dual Version Support**:
  - Standard: Native Claude Code review
  - Enhanced: GPT-5 via Codex CLI
- **Three-tier Status**: Pass / Pass with Risk / Fail

### Enhanced Workflow
- Dev → Review → QA quality chain
- Automatic Sprint plan updates
- Targeted QA test recommendations

## 📊 Quality Scoring Systems

### PRD Quality (100 points)
- Business Value: 30
- Functional Requirements: 25
- User Experience: 20
- Technical Constraints: 15
- Scope & Priorities: 10

### Architecture Quality (100 points)
- Design Quality: 30
- Technology Selection: 25
- Scalability: 20
- Security: 15
- Feasibility: 10

### Review Status
- **Pass**: No issues, proceed to QA

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Repository Context
BMAD automatically scans your repository to understand:
- Technology stack
- Project structure
- Existing patterns
- Dependencies
- Conventions

### Interactive Refinement
Each phase supports iterative improvement:
```
PO: "Here's the PRD (Score: 75/100)"
User: "Add mobile support and offline mode"
PO: "Updated PRD (Score: 92/100) ✅"
```

### Approval Gates
Critical phases require explicit confirmation:
```
Architect: "Technical design complete (Score: 93/100)"
System: "Ready to proceed? (yes/no)"
User: yes
```
